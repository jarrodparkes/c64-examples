Project J - A public game tutorial
==================================

This is part of a write-a-game-tutorial published on the 
Retro Remakes forum. It shows how to write a C64 game
from scratch. 
The used programs are the ACME cross-compiler and two
selfmade sprite/charset editing programs.
Don't expect perfect or even bug-free code.
